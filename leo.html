      <h2>Kumana National Park</h2>
      <p>The Kumana National Park in Sri Lanka is known for its significant leopard population. 
        These leopards are part of the Panthera genus, which also includes lions, tigers, and 
        jaguars. More specifically, the leopards found in the Kumana National Park are members 
        of the Panthera pardus species, specifically the Sri Lankan leopard subspecies.
      These leopards are primarily nocturnal, which means they are most active during the 
      night. This makes them somewhat challenging to observe during the daytime. However, 
      due to their territorial nature, they are often seen moving around during the day, 
      especially near their dens or hunting grounds.</p>

      <h2>Singhagiri Forest</h2>
      <p>The Singhagiri Forest in Sri Lanka is home to the Sri Lankan leopard 
        (Panthera pardus kotiya), a subspecies of the leopard. This leopard 
        subspecies is native to Sri Lanka and has been listed as Vulnerable 
        on the IUCN Red List since 2020, as the population is estimated to 
        be less than 800 mature individuals and is likely declining. The Sri 
        Lankan leopard in the Sinhagiri Forest shares similar characteristics 
        with other leopards. It has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots
        and close-set rosettes.</p>

      <h2>Horton Plains National Park</h2>
      <p>Horton Plains National Park, located in the country's central highlands, is 
        notable for its exceptional highland environment and provides a special environment 
        for Sri Lankan leopards. With its expansive grasslands and cloud forests, this park 
        presents a unique viewpoint on leopard conservation. Horton Plains' varied habitats 
        have allowed leopards to adapt with ease, demonstrating their extraordinary capacity 
        to flourish in mountainous areas. Even though they could be harder to spot here than 
        in other places, persistent observers might get lucky and catch a glimpse of one, 
        especially in the slower times of the day. Discovering Horton Plains offers the 
        opportunity to observe Sri Lankan leopards' flexibility and resiliency in this alluring 
        habitat in addition to providing a peek into the intriguing highland ecology.</p>

      <h2>Leopard Exploitation</h2>
      <p>The illegal trade in leopard skins is a major threat to the Sri Lankan leopard's 
        survival. Leopards are highly valued in the black market for their fur, used in 
        luxury goods like purses and jackets. They are also sold in international markets, 
        including China, due to cultural beliefs. The trade is facilitated by corruption 
        within government agencies and law enforcement, and lacks effective monitoring and 
        control measures. This contributes to the decline of the species' population and 
        is a major concern for wildlife conservationists.
      <br><br>
      Efforts to combat this threat include increasing law enforcement and surveillance, 
      implementing stricter regulations on the import and export of wildlife parts, and 
      raising public awareness about the illegality and harm caused by the trade in leopard skins.

      <h2>Habitat loss</h2>
      <p>Habitat loss is a major threat to the Sri Lankan leopard, causing its population to 
        decline. Degradation of natural habitats leads to fragmentation, restricting leopards 
        movement and access to food. Unplanned development and illegal encroachment are the 
        primary causes of habitat loss, forcing wild animals into smaller spaces. These areas 
        are unsuitable for leopard survival, forcing them into human-dominated areas, causing 
        conflicts between humans and leopards.
      <br>
      Efforts to mitigate habitat loss include planning and sustainable development that takes 
      into account the wilderness and wildlife that may already be living in these areas. This 
      approach can help avoid much of the human-wildlife conflict that arises from habitat loss.
